# News_Category_Classification

## 📁 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying news articles into one of four categories: **World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech**.  
The goal is to build a text classification model using both classical machine learning and neural networks as a bonus.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Classifies news into **4 categories**  
- Implements **Logistic Regression** as the main model  
- Includes a **Neural Network** as a bonus experiment  
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction  

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: AG News Dataset 
- Contains **train** and **test** splits with titles and descriptions  
- Labels:  
  - 1 → World   
  - 2 → Sports   
  - 3 → Business   
  - 4 → Sci/Tech

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Steps
- Text cleaning and normalization  
- Tokenization  
- Stopword removal  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**  

---

## 📊 Model Summary
- **Logistic Regression**: main classifier, strong performance  
- **Neural Network (bonus)**: additional experiment with competitive results
